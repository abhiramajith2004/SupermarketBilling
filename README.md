# SupermarketBilling

The Supermarket Billing system is designed to function as a checkout billing system which allows the customer to purchase the items they require, including checking whether the desired quantity of the required item is available. The administrator gets the functionality to add new products to the inventory, update existing items or delete them. 

The program is built using Python and interfaces with MySQL for using the required databases.
